Scicat Helm Chart

The helm chart does not yet setup the backing mongodb or queuing systems. These need to be installed separatly
(recommendation: use the bitnami charts for qucik and easy setup)


Create a secret 'backend-conf' setting all the needed env vars for backend configuration.
Create a secret 'frontend-conf' with key 'frontend.config.json' and the frontend config json as value.

Adjust the values file for your ingress needs.
